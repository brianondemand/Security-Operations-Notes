## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Wazuh Using the Virtual Machine (OVA)

### 1. **Download the Wazuh Virtual Appliance (OVA)**
   - Download the pre-built Wazuh OVA file for version 4.9.2 from [Wazuh's official site](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/vm/wazuh-4.9.2.ova).

     - **Filebeat-OSS 7.10.2**
     - **Wazuh dashboard 4.9.2**

### 2. **Check System Requirements**
   - Ensure your host system is 64-bit.
   - Enable **hardware virtualization** in the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) of your host.
   - Install a virtualization platform like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** or **Hyper-V**.

   **Default Hardware Configuration for Wazuh VM:**
   - **CPU:** 4 cores
   - **RAM:** 8 GB
   - **Storage:** 50 GB

   *Note:* Modify the configuration based on your needs.
